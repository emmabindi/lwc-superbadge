<!-- 
For this reason, the JavaScript file requires two different attributes to receive information about 
the boat that displays in the tile (boat) and the currently selected boat Id (selectedBoatId). 
Make sure to use the correct decorators for these attributes.

The boat image must be set as the background of a <div> with a class equals to tile and it must be 
  retrieved via a function named backgroundStyle(). The return of this function must be a string that contains the background-image:url() function, showing the boat picture from the field Picture__c on the Boat__c object.

Add the boat name and boat owner to the bottom of the tile, inside a <div> using lower-third as 
  the class for this <div>. Your work must look like the design provided by Renata Pan as seen in all the 
    images present in this project.

The boat name must be inside an <h1> tag using the slds-truncate and slds-text-heading_medium classes.
The boat’s owner’s name must be added to an <h2> tag that uses the slds-truncate and slds-text-heading_small classes.
The boat price must use a Lightning formatted number, with a maximum of two fraction digits, 
in a <div> that uses the slds-text-body_small class.
The boat length must be in a <div> that uses the slds-text-body_small class.
The boat type must be in a <div> that uses the slds-text-body_small class.
